Welcome to PyMinimax's documentation!
=====================================

PyMinimax is a Python implementation of Bien, Jacob, and Robert Tibshirani's 2011 paper “Hierarchical Clustering With Prototypes via Minimax Linkage” [#bien2011hierarchical]_. 
This is an agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm that is not currently available in SciPy nor scikit-learn. 
The API of PyMinimax is SciPy-compatible.
